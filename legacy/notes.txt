BUILDrun
for races (for race and bet)
run buildshare (add result and dividend kwarg)
save to db

BUILDshare
runners, r
combs
- no result
- no dividend
- no pred

PREDICTrun
load combs from db (for race and bet)
run predictshare
save back to db

PREDICTshare
given comb
do pred from model
return comb

1) run buildrun
2) run keras training (will just load from db)
3) run predict
4) run optimization

BETshare
given combs with pred, runners, x
sort runners with highest odds
box from all_runners to r
filter for all combs with runnernumbers in box
break on x numpy.percentile
return runner numbers for box
